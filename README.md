## Determining a ‚ÄúWinner‚Äù:

At the end of the challenge, there will be a list of criteria and a set of benchmarks. The contestants will compare to see who wins in each category. Due to the nuanced nature of home labs however, there will be a guest judge that makes the final decision to determine the winner. 

Judge: üéäJEFF GEERLINGüéä (The True Jeff)

### Challenge Benchmarks:

1. Geekbench CPU Benchmark
    - Choose 1 system, best score wins
2. Total Useable Storage
    - Choose 1 System (SAME AS #3) ‚Äî best score wins
3. Parity (Total number of drives that can fail)
    - Choose 1 system (SAME SYSTEM AS #2)
4. SMB Drag Race - READ
    - Use Crystal Disk Mark - Seq Q8T1
5. SMB Drag Race - WRITE
    - Use Crystal Disk Mark - Seq Q8T1
6. Idle Power
    - Total **Home Lab** power draw while running the *idle workload.*
7. CPU Workload efficiency
    - Choose 1 system
    - Run ffmpeg workload script
        - measure average **SYSTEM** power draw during workload
        - Script will log total render time
        - Total Energy (Wh) = Avg Power (watts) * Render time (hours)
        - lower total energy value wins
8. UPS
    - Must backup entire HL
    - Longest estimated runtime while running *idle workload*

***Ultimately, the Judge makes the final decision by considering both the benchmark results and their own subjective judgment.*** The judge should take into account the performance of the hardware, the quality of the configuration, the overall value proposition, and any other factors that he sees fit.
